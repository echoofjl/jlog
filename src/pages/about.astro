    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      I believe that each of us comes here with only one true purpose: <strong>
        to become who we truly are.</strong
      ><br />
      Every day, I seek to understand this answer.<br /><br />
      When I am happy, I know who I am.<br />
      When I am sad, I know who I am.<br />
      When I am alone, I know who I am.<br />
      When I am with others, I still know.<br /><br />
      Sometimes, the journey to find myself feels so authentic that I forget the
      very reason I started.<br />
      But deep down, I believe there is a principle that rules all beings in this
      world—<br />
      one that we can sense, but can never fully capture with words.

      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        This blog is where I share:
        <ul>
          <li>Technical notes, tutorials, and project learnings</li>
          <li>Book notes, movie thoughts, and broader reflections</li>
          <li>Things I find curious, challenging, or inspiring</li>
        </ul>
        It's a living archive of ideas — a space for both precision and exploration.
